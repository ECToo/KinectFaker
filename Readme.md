# Kinect Skeleton Tracking Emulator

Emulates a Kinect Device (Version 1) with Skeleton Tracking Enabled.
The Emulator enables testing of Kinect Applications without connected Kinect 
by reading Skeleton Animation files.
Currently, only a self defined file format (defined with protobuf) is used and
must be recorded first.


__WIP: interface and file definition are not stable.__
